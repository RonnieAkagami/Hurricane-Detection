# Hurricane Detection Using Deep Learning

## Project Description
This project aims to detect hurricanes using various deep learning models. The models were fine-tuned using hyperparameters to achieve the best possible accuracy. The following models were used in this project:

- **LeNet**
- **MobileNet**
- **VGG16**
- **VGG**
- **Xception**
- **InceptionV3**
- **DenseNet121**
- **ResNet50**
- **Base Model**

The accuracy of each model is shown in the image below:
